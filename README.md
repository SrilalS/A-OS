# A-OS

**Customized Alpine Images for Various Tasks**

> ⚠️ **Note:** This is **NOT** another Linux distribution. A-OS is a collection of customized Alpine Linux images and ISOs tailored for specific tasks and use cases.

## About

A-OS provides pre-configured Alpine Linux images designed to streamline your workflow for various tasks. Rather than building a new Linux distribution from scratch, this project leverages the lightweight, security-focused Alpine Linux base and customizes it with specific tools, configurations, and optimizations for different purposes.

## What is A-OS?

- **Not a Linux Distro:** A-OS is not a new Linux distribution. It uses Alpine Linux as its foundation.
- **Customized Images:** Pre-built Alpine Linux images with task-specific configurations.
- **ISO Files:** Bootable ISO images ready for deployment in various environments.
- **Purpose-Built:** Each image is optimized for specific use cases, reducing setup time and ensuring consistency.

## Why Alpine Linux?

Alpine Linux is chosen as the base for these customized images because of:

- **Small Size:** Minimal footprint ideal for containers and resource-constrained environments
- **Security:** Proactive security features and hardened by default
- **Simplicity:** Simple, clean design without unnecessary bloat
- **Performance:** Fast boot times and efficient resource usage

## Use Cases

These customized Alpine images can be used for:

- Development environments
- Server deployments
- Container base images
- Testing and CI/CD pipelines
- Specialized workstations
- Educational purposes
